The research in intrinsically magnetic two-dimensional materials mainly focuses on synthetic iodide and telluride based compounds, which inherently suffer from the lack of ambient stability. So far, naturally occurring layered magnetic materials have been vastly overlooked. These minerals offer a unique opportunity to explore air-stable complex layered systems with high concentration of local moment bearing ions. We demonstrate magnetic ordering in iron-rich two-dimensional phyllosilicates, focusing on mineral species of minnesotaite, annite, and biotite. These are naturally occurring van der Waals magnetic materials which integrate local moment baring ions of iron via magnesium/aluminium substitution in their octahedral sites. Due to self-inherent capping by silicate/aluminate tetrahedral groups, ultra-thin layers are air-stable. Chemical characterization, quantitative elemental analysis, and iron oxidation states were determined via Raman spectroscopy, wavelength disperse X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry measurements were performed to examine the magnetic ordering. These layered materials exhibit paramagnetic or superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature. At low temperature ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering occurs, with the critical ordering temperature of 38.7 K for minnesotaite, 36.1 K for annite, and 4.9 K for biotite. In-field magnetic force microscopy on iron bearing phyllosilicates confirmed the paramagnetic response at room temperature, present down to monolayers.",60
Sub-Nanometer Channels Embedded in Two-Dimensional Materials,2017,"Yimo Han, Ming-Yang Li, Gang-Seob Jung, Mark A. Marsalis, Zhao Qin, Markus J. Buehler, Lain-Jong Li, David A. Muller",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09880v2,arxiv_results/pdfs/Sub-Nanometer Channels Embedded in Two-Dimensional Materials.pdf,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials are among the most promising candidates for next-generation electronics due to their atomic thinness, allowing for flexible transparent electronics and ultimate length scaling. Thus far, atomically-thin p-n junctions, metal-semiconductor contacts, and metal-insulator barriers have been demonstrated. While 2D materials achieve the thinnest possible devices, precise nanoscale control over the lateral dimensions is also necessary. Here, we report the direct synthesis of sub-nanometer-wide 1D MoS2 channels embedded within WSe2 monolayers, using a dislocation-catalyzed approach. The 1D channels have edges free of misfit dislocations and dangling bonds, forming a coherent interface with the embedding 2D matrix. Periodic dislocation arrays produce 2D superlattices of coherent MoS2 1D channels in WSe2. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified other combinations of 2D materials where 1D channels can also be formed. The electronic band structure of these 1D channels offer the promise of carrier confinement in a direct-gap material and charge separation needed to access the ultimate length scales necessary for future electronic applications.",60
"Magnetic Anisotropy in Two-dimensional van der Waals Magnetic Materials and Their Heterostructures: Importance, Mechanisms, and Opportunities",2025,"Yusheng Hou, Ruqian Wu",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04952v1,"arxiv_results/pdfs/Magnetic Anisotropy in Two-dimensional van der Waals Magnetic Materials and Their Heterostructures Importance, Mechanisms, and Opportunities.pdf","Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) monolayers and heterostructures has attracted significant attention due to its promising potential for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. A key factor in stabilizing long-range magnetic order in these systems is magnetic anisotropy, which plays a crucial role in overcoming the limitations imposed by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. This review provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental overview of the importance of magnetic anisotropy in enabling intrinsic 2D magnetism and shaping the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of 2D vdW materials. We begin by summarizing the fundamental mechanisms that determine magnetic anisotropy, emphasizing the contributions from strong ligand spin-orbit coupling of ligand atoms and unquenched orbital magnetic moments. We then examine a range of material engineering approaches, including alloying, doping, electrostatic gating, strain, and pressure, that have been employed to effectively tune magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Finally, we discuss open challenges and promising future directions in this rapidly advancing field. By presenting a broad perspective on the role of magnetic anisotropy in 2D magnetism, this review aims to stimulate ongoing efforts and new ideas toward the realization of robust, room-temperature applications based on 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures.",60

Non-linear Hall Effects: Mechanisms and Materials,2024,"Arka Bandyopadhyay, Nesta Benno Joseph, Awadhesh Narayan",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02282v2,arxiv_results/pdfs/Non-linear Hall Effects Mechanisms and Materials.pdf,"This review presents recent breakthroughs in the realm of nonlinear Hall effects, emphasizing central theoretical foundations and recent experimental progress. We elucidate the quantum origin of the second-order Hall response, focusing on the Berry curvature dipole, which may arise in inversion symmetry broken systems. The theoretical framework also reveals the impact of disorder scattering effects on the nonlinear response. We further discuss the possibility of obtaining nonlinear Hall responses beyond the second order. We examine symmetry-based indicators essential for the manifestation of nonlinear Hall effects in time-reversal symmetric crystals, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of theoretical models and candidate materials predicted to exhibit sizable and tunable Berry curvature dipole. We summarize groundbreaking experimental reports on measuring both intrinsic and extrinsic nonlinear Hall effects across diverse material classes. Finally, we highlight some of the other intriguing nonlinear effects, including nonlinear planar Hall, nonlinear anomalous Hall, and nonlinear spin and valley Hall effects. We conclude with an outlook on pivotal open questions and challenges, marking the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.",60
A mono-material Nernst thermopile with hermaphroditic legs,2021,"Xiaokang Li, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01467v1,arxiv_results/pdfs/A mono-material Nernst thermopile with hermaphroditic legs.pdf,"A large transverse thermoelectric response, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) has been recently observed in several topological magnets. Building a thermopile employing this effect has been the subject of several recent propositions. Here, we design and build a thermopile with an array of tilted adjacent crystals of Mn$_3$Sn. The design employs a single material and replaces pairs of P and N thermocouples of the traditional design with hermaphroditic legs. The design exploits the large lag angle between the applied field and the magnetization, which we attribute to the interruption of magnetic octupoles at the edge of $xy$-plane. Eliminating extrinsic contacts between legs will boost the efficiency, simplify the process and pave the way for a new generation of thermopiles.",60
Transport in two-dimensional topological materials: recent developments in experiment and theory,2019,"Dimitrie Culcer, Aydin Cem Keser, Yongqing Li, Grigory Tkachov",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10058v1,arxiv_results/pdfs/Transport in two-dimensional topological materials recent developments in experiment and theory.pdf,"We review theoretical and experimental highlights in transport in two-dimensional materials focussing on key developments over the last five years. Topological insulators are finding applications in magnetic devices, while Hall transport in doped samples and the general issue of topological protection remain controversial. In transition metal dichalcogenides valley-dependent electrical and optical phenomena continue to stimulate state-of-the-art experiments. In Weyl semimetals the properties of Fermi arcs are being actively investigated. A new field, expected to grow in the near future, focuses on the non-linear electrical and optical responses of topological materials, where fundamental questions are once more being asked about the intertwining roles of the Berry curvature and disorder scattering. In topological superconductors the quest for chiral superconductivity, Majorana fermions and topological quantum computing is continuing apace.",60
Chirality driven topological electronic structure of DNA-like materials,2020,"Yizhou Liu, Jiewen Xiao, Jahyun Koo, Binghai Yan",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08881v2,arxiv_results/pdfs/Chirality driven topological electronic structure of DNA-like materials.pdf,"Topological aspects of the geometry of DNA and similar chiral molecules have received a lot of attention, while the topology of their electronic structure is less explored. Previous experiments have revealed that DNA can efficiently filter spin-polarized electrons between metal contacts, a process called chiral-induced spin-selectivity (CISS). However, the underlying correlation between chiral structure and electronic spin remains elusive. In this work, we reveal an orbital texture in the band structure, a topological characteristic induced by the chirality. We find that this orbital texture enables the chiral molecule to polarize the quantum orbital. This orbital polarization effect (OPE) induces spin polarization assisted by the spin-orbit interaction from a metal contact and leads to magnetorestistance and chiral separation. The orbital angular momentum of photoelectrons also plays an essential role in related photoemission experiments. Beyond CISS, we predict that OPE can induce spin-selective phenomena even in achiral but inversion-breaking materials.",60
Multiflavor Mott insulators in quantum materials and ultracold atoms,2021,"Gang V. Chen, Congjun Wu",materials,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02630v2,arxiv_results/pdfs/Multiflavor Mott insulators in quantum materials and ultracold atoms.pdf,"Mott insulators with large and active (or multiflavor) local Hilbert spaces widely occur in quantum materials and ultracold atomic systems, and are dubbed ""multiflavor Mott insulators"". For these multiflavored Mott insulating materials, the spin-only description with the quadratic spin interactions is often insufficient to capture the major physical processes. In the situation with active orbitals, the Kugel-Khomskii superexchange model was then proposed. We briefly review this historical model and discuss the modern developments beyond the original spin-orbital context. These include and are not restricted to the $4d$/$5d$ transition metal compounds with the spin-orbit-entangled $J=3/2$ quadruplets, the rare-earth magnets with two weakly-separated crystal field doublets, breathing magnets and/or the cluster and molecular magnets, et al. We explain the microscopic origin of the emergent Kugel-Khomskii physics in each realization with some emphasis on the $J=3/2$ quadruplets, and refer the candidate multiflavor Mott insulators as ""$J=3/2$ Mott insulators"". For the ultracold atoms, we review the multiflavor Mott insulator realization with the ultracold alkaline and alkaline-earth atoms on the optical lattices. Despite a large local Hilbert space from the atomic hyperfine spin states, the system could naturally realize a large symmetry group such as the Sp($N$) and SU($N$) symmetries. These ultracold atomic systems lie in the large-$N$ regime of these symmetry groups and are characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. The Kugel-Khomskii physics and the exotic quantum ground states with the ""baryon-like"" physics can appear in various limits. We conclude with our vision and outlook on this subject.",60
